# Product Brief

Transform unstructured idea material into a clear, structured product brief that can feed into market validation.

## Core Purpose

This skill distills chaos into clarity. It accepts messy input—voice transcriptions, rambling notes, single sentences—and produces a structured brief suitable for validation.

**Accepts:**
- Voice transcriptions (rambling 2-3 minute stories)
- Pages of unstructured notes
- Single sentence ideas
- Stream of consciousness dumps
- File paths to existing content

**Produces:**
- A timestamped product brief at `.plan/product/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`
- An index file at `.plan/product/brief.md` linking to all briefs
- Foundation document for `/pro:product.validate`

## Element Extraction

Parse the input to identify:

| Signal Type | What to Look For |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Problem** | Pain points, frustrations, gaps mentioned |
| **Solution** | What they want to build, how it helps |
| **Customer** | Who they're talking about, who has the problem |
| **Timing** | Why now, what's changed, urgency |
| **Business** | How money might flow, pricing thoughts |

## Clarifying Questions

If critical elements are missing, ask focused questions.

**Only ask if truly unclear:**
- Who specifically has this problem? (if target customer is vague)
- How do people solve this today? (if no competitive context)
- Why would someone pay for this? (if value prop is unclear)

**Do NOT ask about:**
- Technical implementation details
- Exact pricing
- Team composition
- Funding needs

Keep questions focused on the problem/solution/customer.

## Brief Template

```markdown
# Product Brief

**Working Title:** [Name or one-line description]
**Created:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]

---

## Problem Statement

What specific problem are we solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How painful is it? (hair-on-fire vs. nice-to-have)
- How do they solve it today?

---

## Proposed Solution

What are we building?
- Core value proposition (one sentence)
- Key capabilities
- What makes it different from alternatives?

---

## Target Customer

### Primary
- Who specifically will buy this?
- What triggers them to look for a solution?

### Secondary (if applicable)
- Adjacent segments
- B2B opportunities

---

## Why Now?

What's changed that makes this viable/necessary?
- Market shifts
- Technology enablers
- Behavioral changes
- Regulatory/policy changes

---

## Business Model Hypothesis

How does money flow?
- Revenue model (subscription, one-time, freemium, etc.)
- Pricing intuition (ballpark, not exact)
- Who pays vs. who uses?

---

## Key Assumptions

What must be true for this to work?
1. [Assumption 1]
2. [Assumption 2]
3. [Assumption 3]

## Open Questions

What don't we know yet?
- [ ] [Question 1]
- [ ] [Question 2]
- [ ] [Question 3]

*Generated by /pro:product.brief*
*Ready for validation: `/pro:product.validate`*
```

## File Storage

### Directory Structure

```
.plan/product/
├── brief.md                              # Index linking to all briefs
├── briefs/
│   ├── 2026-01-07-user-analytics.md      # Timestamped individual briefs
│   └── 2026-01-05-payment-flow.md
```

### Filename Generation

1. Extract the Working Title from the brief
2. Slugify: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, remove special characters
3. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`

Example: `2026-01-07-user-analytics-dashboard.md`

### Index Format

```markdown
# Product Briefs

This directory contains product briefs created with `/pro:product.brief`.
Each brief captures a product idea ready for validation.

| Date | Title | Path |
|------|-------|------|
| 2026-01-07 | User Analytics Dashboard | [View](briefs/2026-01-07-user-analytics-dashboard.md) |
| 2026-01-05 | Payment Flow | [View](briefs/2026-01-05-payment-flow.md) |

## Quick Actions

- **Validate latest:** `/pro:product.validate` (uses most recent brief)
- **Validate specific:** `/pro:product.validate .plan/product/briefs/{file}.md`

*Generated by /pro:product.brief*
```

### Index Maintenance

When creating a new brief:
1. If index doesn't exist, create it with header
2. Add new entry to the table
3. Sort entries by date (newest first)

## Legacy Migration

If `.plan/product/brief.md` exists and is NOT an index (doesn't start with `# Product Briefs`):

1. Read the existing brief
2. Extract its Working Title and Created date
3. Move it to `briefs/` with appropriate timestamped name
4. Create fresh index including the migrated brief
5. Inform user: "Migrated existing brief to versioned format."

## Tone Guidelines

Be helpful and encouraging at this stage:
- This is idea capture, not validation
- Help them articulate what's in their head
- Don't judge the idea yet (that's validate's job)
- Focus on clarity and completeness

## Summary Output

After creating a brief, show:

```
## Brief Created

**Problem:** [one sentence]
**Solution:** [one sentence]

Saved to: `.plan/product/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`
Index updated: `.plan/product/brief.md`

**Next step:** Run `/pro:product.validate` to get harsh market validation.
```
